# Svelte TextMate Grammar

Hosting TextMate grammars for the syntax highlighting of Svelte files.

This project is forked from [sveltejs/language-tools](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/d0950e6b024e46b62e23324ea7ef92a16fe18924). It's the classic version originally authored by [James Birtles](https://github.com/jamesbirtles). The reason for this fork is that sveltejs/language-tools now has a new version of the grammar that uses an injection-based approach, which is not compatible with some tools.
